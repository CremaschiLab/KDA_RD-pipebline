# KDA_RD-pipebline
Knapsack problem based heuristic algorithms

# Summery
This repository contains the data and code needed to test a knapsack problem-based heuristic approach to phamarceutical R&D pipeline management.

Please note that Core is a work-in-progress. The current version as of June 04, 2018 has been copied into this repository for result reproducibility. An up-to-date version can be found at the public repo https://github.com/CremaschiLab/KDA_RD-pipebline

# Quickstart
###1. Cloning To obtain a copy of the source code
###2. Run
The command line: python Solver.py solve-method=MSSP data-file=modeldata.dat
solve-method: specific the solving methods, options: MSSP/KDA
data-file: specific the test data file, which include in the Problem Files in this repository.
###3. The results 
After it starts, it will create a solution file

# Data
The test data is in Problem Files

# Solver File
The solver file include both multistage stochastic programming model (MSSP) and knapsack problem-based heuristic approach (KDA) to phamarceutical R&D pipeline.
